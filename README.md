# ThemeWork

Welcome to **ThemeWork**, the first framework for PHP that not only lets you create distinct themes easily but allows you to create entirely separate configurations, functionality and more!

Also, in keeping with the theming nature, **ThemeWork** gives you the ability to *automagically* auto inject JS and CSS frameworks directly into your themes as well, using the most current versions hosted off the fasted CDN's.

**ThemeWork** also has some of the most verbose debuging information there is making it extremely easy to see exactly what is happening at all times, from what is and isn't being called, passed and set to errors that are found along the way.

Now, all of this is just a few extra added features. The real core of this framework, and the part that you'll be most concerned with, is that it runs on only 10 core files at any given time. (that's not including a driver or two that it needs, such as MySQL)

This is an amazingly fast and versatile framework that can scale quickly, easily, securily and robustly.

** Keep in mind though, as you read this, that this framework is in production and far from done at the moment. It's missing a LOT!

## Getting Started

Upload the files to your server and load up the destination in your browser. You should see a page telling you that it's working and that you're missing a config file and your database information.

## Still Missing

While this is a work in progress, you have to understand that a lot is still missing.

Next in line to be completed is the MySQL driver as well as the DB "active record" interface.

After that will come security methods, caching, custom routes and more.
