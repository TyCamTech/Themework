Basic barebones beginning to an MVC framework by Stuart Duncan

Still needs a LOT of work. This is just the beginning of the foundation which still, itself, requires a lot of work.

Some core differences for this MVC compared to others are:
 - the use of 'themes' in place of regular views or templates
 - more OOP right from the opening core yet substantial functions as well, like CI

This will hopefully grow a lot in time.
